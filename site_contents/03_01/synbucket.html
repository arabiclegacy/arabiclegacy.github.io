Synbucket is a tool to add and rehearse synonyms. It can be used effectively for learning languages vocabularies. Its idea is to provide a way for quickly revising some synonyms that user adds himself to his words database.
Therefore, it has basically two main functionalities: Adding Synonyms or Revising Synonyms.
<br>
<br>
When user adds synonyms, it will be added to one associated CSV file called "Bucket.csv". When user revises synonyms, Synbucket will load words that have been saved in user database.
Using Synbucket, user can be able to rehearse about 50 words in about 10 minutes (if he can recall it in enough time). When user gets familiar and certain about what he memorized in "Bucket.csv", he can archive these words 
into another database called "Depot.csv". User has the option to rehearse words from either "Bucket.csv" or "Depot.csv". But when he adds new words, it will be added to "Bucket.csv" directly. To move words from "Bucket.csv" 
into "Depot.csv", user has to click on 'archive' option
<br>
<br>
WITHOUT "Bucket.csv" AND "Depot.csv" SYNBUCKET WILL NOT RUN, THESE TWO FILES ARE MUST TO EXIST WITH THE SAME DIRECTORY OF SYNBUCKET
<br>
<br>
To have a review over what is saved in user database, there is one feature to review either "Bucket.csv" or "Depot.csv". There, the user can delete some words, order them, shuffle them
